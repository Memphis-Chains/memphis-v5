# SUCCESS-PATH.md — memphis-v4

Real-deal.

## Goal
Turn `memphis-v4` from a strong internal baseline into a trusted public project people can adopt.

## Stage 1 — Public-ready baseline (Now)
- [x] Clean repository line
- [x] Release `v0.1.0`
- [x] Working agreement + release process
- [x] Rust Phase 0 entry (workspace/core/napi/fallback)
- [x] License + public-facing README

Success signal:
- A new user can understand what the project is, run it, and see roadmap direction in <10 minutes.

## Stage 2 — Credibility sprint (Next 7 days)
1. Keep gates green every merge (`lint/typecheck/test/build/cargo test`).
2. Ship `v0.1.1` documentation/process hardening release.
3. Publish one short architecture post (what changed, why this structure).
4. Stabilize one simple Rust->NAPI->TS demo path and document it.

Success signal:
- Public readers can verify progress from commits/releases/docs without private context.

## Stage 3 — Product trust (Next 2-4 weeks)
1. Complete Blueprint P0 with repeatable CI.
2. Start Blueprint Phase 1 (vault track) in controlled slices.
3. Introduce issue labels + milestone board (P0/P1/P2).
4. Maintain release cadence (small, verified releases).

Success signal:
- Contributors can join without guesswork.
- Releases map directly to roadmap checkpoints.

## Non-negotiable operating rules
- Pro quality > speed
- No shortcut merges under pressure
- Every significant change has rollback path
- Keep mainline understandable for outsiders
